# Analysis of Algorithms

## Exercise I

a) `O(n)` => As the value of n increases the number of iterations through the while loop increases at the same rate, i.e. linearly.

b) `n * n * n * constant = n^3 * constant = n^3 = O(n^3)` => Each `for` loop has an algorithmic complexity of O(n) except the last `for` loop. The last `for` loop has an algorithmic complexity of O(1) since it will only ever run 9 times.

c) `n = O(n)`
